# Chat App

 ## Intro

 Chat App for both Android/iOS created with React Native. The app provides users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location.

 
 ## User Stories

- As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my
friends and family.
- As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange
the latest news.
- As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
- As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
- As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any
time.
- As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen
reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.

 ## Key Features

 - A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen
 before joining the chat.
 - A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
 - The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images
 and location data.
 - Data gets stored online and offline
